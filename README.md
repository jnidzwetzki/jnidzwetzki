### Hi there 👋

I am Jan, software developer with a focus on distributed databases and distributed systems. I am 35 years old, live in Berlin (Germany), and work for around 18 years in IT. I worked as system administrator, network administrator, software developer, and CTO. I am also a PhD student at the University of Hagen.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [BBoxDB](https://bboxdb.org) a distrbuted key-bounding-box-value store (see [full paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10619-019-07275-w)) (part of my PhD thesis).

- 🌱 I’m also maintaining [SECONDO](http://dna.fernuni-hagen.de/secondo/) - an extensible database management system developed at the university at Hagen. See [Distributed SECONDO](http://dna.fernuni-hagen.de/secondo/DSecondo/DSECONDO-Website/index.html) a [distributed version](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-22363-6_28) of SECONDO.

- 📚 I am the author of the book [Entwicklung eines skalierbaren und verteilten Datenbanksystems](https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783658124434) (my master thesis, awarded as outstanding work and available as a book published by Springer). 

- 💬 I also talked at international conferences ([SSTD](http://sstd2015.org/), [IEEE BigData](http://cse.ucdenver.edu/~BSD2019/), [CIKM](https://www.cikm2018.units.it/), ...) about databases and published some peer-reviewed  scientific papers. Have a look at my [Demo Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9005999), which won the IEEE best demo- and short paper award at the [BSD2019](http://cse.ucdenver.edu/~BSD2019/).

- 🤔 I’m looking for help on my [MySQL highly-available cloud container orchestrator](https://github.com/jnidzwetzki/mysql-ha-cloud).

- ⚡ Fun fact: My first installed Linux Distribution was a SuSE 6.1 (Kernel 2.2.6) in 1999, and my first computer was a Pentium 1 with 100 MHz and 16 MB RAM running Windows 95.
